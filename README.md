# R programming end-to-end session

This repository is for the instructional materials for the end-to-end R programming session at the [Data Science Nigeria AI Bootcamp 2020](https://www.datasciencenigeria.org/2020-bootcamp/) delivered by the RStudio Certified Instructor, [Ezekiel Adebayo Ogundepo](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/ogundepo+ezekiel_adebayo/).

The R programming end-to-end session teaches R programming from scratch and solved questions in the Tidyverse certification sample exam provided by the RStudio for intermediate and advanced R users. This exam tests your skills and knowledge of the Tidyverse ecosystem. There are two steps in obtaining the Tidyverse certification:

1. Participate in a one-day training course that focuses on teaching methodologies. 

2. Then, you need to pass two exams: a teaching exam and a coding exam. For more information on how to get certified, you can navigate to the trainers' site.
